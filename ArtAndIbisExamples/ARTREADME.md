## This is the folder that contains all of my art examples form Ibis paint! 
## I have used these in multiple places. Some being commissions, come being practice art, and some being game assets. 
## I would recommend using tile view for the files as they are not named. 
## Just open the "Pictures" folder to see some of my best examples!
